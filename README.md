DESCRIPTION
============

Cyclops Staring Contest is an eye-controlled video game implemented using the Tobii EyeX Controller, Unity, and C#.

============
INSTALLATION
============

To play Cyclops Staring Contest, copy the entire Releases > Cyclops_v1-0 folder to your Windows computer. Inside the Cyclops_v1-0 folder, run Cyclops.exe to launch the game. Do not modify any of the other files inside the Cyclops_v1-0 folder, as they are required for the game to run.

HOW TO PLAY
============

From the main menu, you may toggle the controls that will be used during play. If you wish to use eye controls, make sure that your eye tracker is fully operational and calibrated prior to starting the game. During play, your gaze position will be determined by where you are looking on the screen. Alternatively, you may test the game using mouse controls. In this case, the position of the mouse cursor is used to determine where you are focused on the screen. The game is intended to be played with eye controls, but the mouse option is useful for debugging and testing when an eye tracker is not available. 

Click on the Play button from the main menu to begin the game. 

At the start of each round, the Cyclops will awaken and initiate the staring contest. The contest will begin once you look into the Cyclops' pupil. Your objective is to stay focused on the Cyclops' pupil without blinking or looking away. If you maintain focus longer than the Cyclops, you will win the round. If you blink or look away too soon, you will lose the round.

After each round, you will be taken to a summary screen. Statistics for the latest round, as well as your total number of wins, will be displayed. From here, you can continue to the next round or return to the main menu. The more times you win and continue, the harder it will become to defeat the Cyclops. Alternatively, if you return to the main menu, your statistics will be reset and the game will begin anew.
